WHAT WE FOUND - INFORMATION DISCOVERED

1. HID Protocol Structure (100% Solved)

65-byte HID reports discovered
Report ID: 0x02, Command: 0x01 (SetStatic) was set
576-byte batch processing (8-9 report) system solved
It was discovered that the HyperX Generic Keyboard protocol was used
2. Windows API Chain (100% Mapped)

OmenLighting_Keyboard_SetStatic() → sub_1800489E0() → sub_180046E50() → HidD_SetFeature()
3. DeviceKeys Enum (100% Removed)

104 key mappings were obtained from the Aurora project
Critical keys such as ESC=1, A=60, W=40, S=61, D=62 were determined

576-byte buffer 4-byte per key 
65-byte chunks transmission 

It's almost over, the first trials will start for trial purposes.
I'm thinking of an unregulated MVP for 2 weeks, the number of supported models is around 10 for now. 
I'm not sure about PID and Vendor ID.

Good news, I solved the zone structure, and when sending HID directly didn't work, I realized that it was EC, albeit late, but I use it with an if else that won't be wasted.
Today I started to solve the Virtual HID driver structure and almost created the architecture. 
It is more complex than I expected, but it will probably take 6-7 days to make a user space tool for testing purposes.

 LOOK: I decompiled the complete.sys file from the beginning bit by bit , I'm only halfway through

Part 1: Virtual HID Framework (VHFK, device context, memory management)
Part 2: IOCTL Processing (0xB0329, state machine, VHF dispatch)
Part 3: Driver Entry (DriverEntry, CPU optimization, security features)

Direct ec writing is okay, but it's dangerous, the acpi test tool is stuck.
I don't know, anyway, I wrote a device detection system for the driver, it's quite wrong.
I have a few more tools, but I don't share it because it's mostly patched and makeshift.
I'm thinking of making a tesepit tool for contribution when the MVP is finished.

System Info:
  Vendor: HP
  Product: Victus by HP Gaming Laptop 16-s0xxx

🎯 WORKING RGB METHODS:
----------------------
✅ \_SB.WMID.WQAB - RGB COMMAND SUCCESSFUL!

⚠️  EXISTING BUT NON-WORKING METHODS:
------------------------------------
⚠️  \_SB.WMID.WMAA - Exists but SECU test failed: AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT

SUMMARY:
--------
Total tested: 25
Methods found: 2
Working RGB methods: 1

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
✅ SUCCESS! Update main driver to use working method(s)
1. Copy working path.method to main driver
2. Test with different RGB colors
3. Implement full RGB control
