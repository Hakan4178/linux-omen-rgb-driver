   reddit: u/hakanberk7 Linux kernel driver for HP Omen RGB keyboard - Mainline goal
CURRENTLY İN REVERSE ENGİNEERİNG!
Note: Reverse engineering is finished for the minimum limited features. I'm going crazy with Linux user space virtual drive issues. I want this whole project to work on both the Victus and Omen series, or in general, on every device that runs Omen Light Studio. I'll also write a simple user space tool for testing purposes, but the main purpose is the kernel. I'll leave an advanced API for the user space. The program has an extremely complex flow.

Today I am very tired but finish ACPI reverse phase find all ACPI command set.

21:45 I wrote a simple driver right now, let's see if the ACPI commands are correct.

Many, many, many problems
