# linux-omen-rgb-driver
Linux kernel driver for HP Omen RGB keyboard - Mainline goal
Currently in reverse engineering phase 
Note: Reverse engineering is finished for the minimum limited features. I'm going crazy with Linux user space virtual drive issues, so I'm taking a break. I want this whole project to work on both the Victus and Omen series, or in general, on every device that runs Omen Light Studio. I'll also write a simple user space tool for testing purposes, but the main purpose is the kernel. I'll leave an advanced API for the user space. The program has an extremely complex flow.
